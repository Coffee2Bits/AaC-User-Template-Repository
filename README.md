# Template Architecture-as-Code (AaC) User Repository
This repository is a Github Template Repository for working with the [Architecture-as-Code](https://github.com/jondavid-black/AaC) tool.

# Example Model
This repository contains an example model `EchoExample` in `src/model/example_model/example_model.yaml` which the user can interact and use to explore some of the AaC functionality. 

The example model is also used in the this repository's Github Actions Workflow to demonstrate incorporating the AaC python package into an AaC project's CI/CD workflow.
